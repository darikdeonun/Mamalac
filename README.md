# Mamalac
Can Mamalac be given with baby formula, or only with breastfeeding? [Mamalac](https://vorwartspharma.pl/en/product/mamalac-2/) is taken both during breastfeeding and with milk infant formulas. How quickly does Mamalac work? Mamalac acts immediately as soon as it enters the intestines and binds to milk lactose. Food supplement that helps mothers meet their nutritional needs while enhancing their milk production. If hormone therapy or breast stimulation treatments are not the route you'd like to go, you can check out a feeding aide that delivers formula or milk through a device that attaches to your breast. For an erotic alternative, you could also drizzle milk on your breasts and invite your partner to imbibe that way.
